This project utilized PowerBI Desktop to conduct a comprehensive analysis of an anomaly detection dataset. 
Beginning with meticulous data import and cleaning processes, the focus was on ensuring data accuracy and consistency. 
Leveraging the capabilities of Data Analysis Expressions (DAX), advanced calculations and measures were created to derive meaningful insights. 
The subsequent phase involved the use of various visualizations, including charts and graphs, to effectively represent data patterns and anomalies. The project culminated in the development of a dynamic dashboard hosted on PowerBI Service, providing a collaborative platform for exploration and showcasing key findings in an accessible manner. This holistic approach covered data import, cleaning, DAX utilization, visualization, anomaly identification, and dynamic dashboard creation, ensuring a thorough and insightful analysis of the anomaly detection dataset.
